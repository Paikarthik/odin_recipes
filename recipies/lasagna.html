  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p> Lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. </br>
    <p>A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. </br>
    <p>I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
