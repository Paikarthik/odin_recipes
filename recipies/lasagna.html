  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    A hearty and satisfying homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
    A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta, but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
    I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread for a complete Italian-inspired meal.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><i>1/2</i> pound ground pork</li>
    <li><i>1/2</i> pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li><i>1/2</i> cup minced onion</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li><i>1/2</i> teaspoon oregano</li>
    <li><i>1/8</i> teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1 package lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>1 pound small curd cottage cheese</li>
    <li><i>3/4</i> cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li><i>1/4</i> teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>16 ounce package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large skillet, cook ground pork, ground beef, and minced onion over medium heat until browned. Drain the fat.</li>
    <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon parsley, garlic, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, oregano, and sugar. Simmer for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Cook lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon parsley, 2 teaspoons salt, and black pepper. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>Spread 1/3 of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer with 1/3 of the noodles, then 1/3 of the cheese mixture, and 1/3 of the shredded mozzarella. Repeat layers two more times, ending with mozzarella on top.</li>
    <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake an additional 25 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly and lightly golden.</li>
    <li>Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
  </ol>
